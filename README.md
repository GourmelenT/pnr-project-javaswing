### Project Regional Nature Park (RNP) ###
This project involved creating a Java Swing application for the Gulf of Morbihan Regional Nature Park. The aim was to enable them to integrate data acquired in the field directly into a single application.

By following the specifications given by the RNP, we were able to develop the application to meet the customer's needs. We have a MySQL database and a Java Swing application.

In the following video, you'll see the application that my team and I created.
